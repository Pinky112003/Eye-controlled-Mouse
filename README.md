An eye-controlled mouse, also known as an eye-tracking mouse, is an input device that allows users to control the cursor on a computer screen using their eye movements. This assistive technology is primarily designed for individuals with limited mobility or disabilities, offering hands-free interaction with digital devices. Here's how it typically works:

Eye Tracking Camera: A specialized camera, often embedded in or attached to the computer, tracks the movement of the user's eyes. It uses infrared light to illuminate the eyes and detect reflections from the retina and cornea to determine where the user is looking.

Calibration: Before use, the system is calibrated to each individual's eyes, mapping their gaze to specific screen locations. Calibration ensures that the device accurately interprets where the user is looking.

Gaze Detection: The system translates the user's gaze into a control signal. When the user looks at a specific point on the screen, the eye-controlled mouse interprets this as a cursor movement to that location.

Dwell Time or Blink Selection: To simulate a "click," the system often uses a dwell time (hovering the eyes over an object for a set amount of time) or a blink pattern to perform actions like clicking, double-clicking, or right-clicking.

Software Integration: Eye-controlled mice work seamlessly with common operating systems, allowing users to navigate web pages, create documents, play games, or use communication tools without the need for traditional physical devices like a keyboard or mouse.

This technology is highly beneficial for individuals with physical disabilities such as quadriplegia, ALS, or cerebral palsy, allowing them greater independence in interacting with digital environments.
